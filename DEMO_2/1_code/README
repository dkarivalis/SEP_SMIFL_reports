To run the code you need to have an Ubuntu 12.04 machine with Play 2.2.2 and
MySQL (from the ubuntu repositories (sudo apt-get install mysql-server)).
To run the unit tests, you simply need Ubuntu 12.04 and Play 2.2.2, then in the
root directory of the application run Play ~test.

For more instruction on running the application see the README inside the
zipped folder.  README.md is a github specific file, you want README.

If you have any questions, please feel free to email david.patrzeba@gmail.com

Please note that our application is difficult to set up since it is a fairly
complicated system; that is we rely on the Play Framework (MVC framework),
MySQL DB, EBean ORM, SecureSocial, system global ENV variables, etc.

This application is not designed to be run natively, rather, we have designed it
to expose REST endpoints to later add truly native apps, should we choose to
pursue that avenue of approach.  If you absolutely must run the code, it is best
to contact david.patrzeba@gmail.com.

The wiki located at:
https://github.com/dkarivalis/SEP_SMIFL/wiki
will have more up to date instructions and walkthroughs on setting up the
application in a virtual machine.
