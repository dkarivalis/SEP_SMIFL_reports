\chapter{Team Profile}

Team 1 will be working on \href{http://ece.rutgers.edu/~marsic/books/SE/projects/}
{Project 5: Stock Market Investment Fantasy League} and have named their project
''Paramount Investments League''. This project is intended to serve
as an exercise in software engineering focusing on building experience in the design,
architecture, construction, test, and maintenance of a small-to-mid sized complex
software application.\\

At this time a project lead has not been elected, but David Patrzeba will be acting
as technical lead.  All members will have input on the decisions of the team and
communication is being facilitated by a project mailing list, git repositories,
a wiki, and google+ hangouts.\\

highly familiar with iterative software design and object oriented design patterns.
David also has experience with Android development, relational database schema, and
user experience.  David will be acting as a technical lead on the project.

\section{Eric Jacob}

Eric is proficient with the Java, C, and C++ languages, and SQL.  Eric also has
experience with Bash scripting and Python.

\section{Evan Arbeitman}

\chapter{Project Proposal}
\label{proposal}
Team 1 has elected to work on \href{http://ece.rutgers.edu/~marsic/books/SE/projects/}
{Project 5: Stock Market Investment Fantasy League} with the goal of implementing a
web application to service a core audience of novice investors in introducing them to
the ins and outs of tradeable assets.  Novice investors come from all ages and backgrounds
but tend to fall into the 16-30 year old crowd.  By "game-ifying" the action of trading
stocks by allowing users to collect achievments and be rewarded in interesting ways, the
goal is to maintain their intrest in the application.

OLD STUFF:

We intend to use a RESTful API for executing all requests by the end user
allowing easy expansion to the desktop and mobile application domains. We are deploying to
a \href{http://www.digitialocean.com}{DigitalOcean} Virtual Private Server (droplet) which
will allow us to scale as necessary, both vertically and horizontally.\\

The goal of our web application is to act as the initial and primary interface to our backend
services. These will include the ability to conduct buy, sell, short, stop, and limit orders on
at least the NYSE and NASDAQ stock exchanges.  We also plan to support global leader boards,
individual leagues with goals (eg. first to double their money, first to gain 8\% in a day, etc...),
and global achievements (similar to xBox achievments).\\

Because our project will be built using RESTful principles, it will be able to act as a
platform that can be extended by third parties to implement new and innovative features.
Some scenarios include trading tutorials, and stock prediction integration.  These are not
of our primary concern.

\section{Resgistration}

The end user should be able to register and login to the system in a simple and straight forward
manner requesting the least amount of information necessary in order to start using the system.

The project plans to use OpenID in order to perform authorization and validation of our users.
It also allows the project to easily scrape data from our users and prefill their profile for them.
This should also allow the project to integrate easy with social media.

\section{Social Media Integration}

End users should be able to push messages to their social media personality that indicate
recent trades that they have made or achievments that they have earned.

The project will initially integrate with social media to push out messages about trades and
achievments. This feature will be able to be turned on and off by the end user, and will support
multiple social applications.

\section{Transactions Ticker}

All site vistors should see a ticker of the most recent trades scroll across the bottom of their
screen at a speed such that they can read and process the information easily much like seen on
CNBC.

The project plans to implement a static transactions ticker which will scoll across the bottom
of the users screen similar to what you would see on CNBC.  It will be visible to all users
of the website, whehter logged in or not.  We will also include the indices of the Dow Jones
Industral Average (DJIA), the Standards \& Poor 500 (S\&P500), and the NASDAQ in a static box
also much like you would see on CNBC.

\section{Unified Interfaces}

The end should experience a unified experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop browsers.
The customer should be able to use the major modern browsers Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and
Internet Explorer.

The project plans to use \href{http://getbootstrap.com}{Bootstrap} to provide mobile first
front-end for the website.  By doing this, it allows the project to provide a consistant
user experience across all platforms.  This also serves as a first iteration into the
mobile/tablet market and gives us a good blue print for a second iteration focused on
native mobile/tablet applications.

\section{Portfolio Management}

The end user should be able to place orders to buy, sell, short, stop, and limit, on any
tradeable asset available on the NYSE and the NASDAQ. The user should be able to
cancel any pending orders that have not gone through (eg, a limit order that hasn't triggered).

\section{Graphs and News}

End users should be presented with a news feed related to his/her portfolio.
Additionally they should be able to manipulate graphs in order to compare
performance of a variety of tradeable assets.

The project plans to implement interactive charting for your portfolio using
\href{http://www.highcharts.com/products/highstock}{HighStock}.  This will allow
end users to conduct analysis on their portfolio using visual aids.  The project
will also implement a news feed, which will update with the latest finacial news
for companies that are in your portfolio, and companies that you may be tracking.

\section{Email Updates}

The end user should be able to receive email updates at a frequency and granularity that they choose.

The project will facilitate a variety of email updates to the end user.  Some examples are
transaction confirmation, daily, weekly and monthly portfolio updates, league updates, and
site updates.  The user will be able to select which email updates they would like to suscribe
to.

\section{Educational Interfaces}

End users should be able to mouse over investment terms (eg, P/E ratio) and see a pop up
dialog with a brief description and links to internal and external resources.

The project plans to implement definition boxes for investment terms across the website.
Certain terms (eg. P/E) will be highlighted and by mousing over them a dialogue box will pop
up with a definition and links to external resources for a more in depth analysis.

\section{Leagues}

End users should be able to create, modify, and participate in leagues that agree to a customizable
set of rules to determine a winner (eg, the first to double their money).  Leagues should be able
to be set up by any end user and be made public or private.

\section{Achievments}

End users should receive recognition of achievments accomplished (eg, earn 10\% in a month) and
be rewarded with additional play money, stocks, and other novel rewards.
