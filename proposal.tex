\chapter{Team Profile}

Team 1 will be working on \href{http://ece.rutgers.edu/~marsic/books/SE/projects/}
{Project 5: Stock Market Investment Fantasy League} and they have named their project
``The Paramount Investments League''. This project is intended to serve
as an exercise in software engineering focusing on building experience in the design,
architecture, construction, test, and maintenance of a small-to-mid sized complex
software application.\\

At this time a project lead has not been elected, but David Patrzeba will be acting
as technical lead.  All members will have input on the decisions of the team and
communication is being facilitated by a project mailing list, git repositories,
a wiki, and google+ hangouts.\\

\chapter{Project Proposal}
\label{proposal}
Team 1 has elected to work on \href{http://ece.rutgers.edu/~marsic/books/SE/projects/}
{Project 5: Stock Market Investment Fantasy League} with the goal of implementing a
web application to service a core audience of novice investors in introducing them to
the ins and outs of tradable assets.  Novice investors come from all ages and backgrounds
but tend to fall into the 16-30 year old crowd.  By "game-ifying" the action of trading
stocks; by allowing users to collect achievements and be rewarded in interesting ways; we
plan to maintain their interest in the game and grow the user base while simultaneously
teaching them basic investment strategies.

\section{Registration}

The end user should be able to register and login to the system in a simple and straight forward
manner requesting the least amount of information necessary in order to start using the system.

\section{Social Media Integration}

End users should be able to push messages to their social media personality that indicate
recent trades that they have made or achievements that they have earned.  End
user will have control over when and to what services they want messages pushed
to.

\section{Transactions Ticker}

All site visitors should see a ticker of the most recent trades scroll across the
bottom of their screen at a speed such that they can read and process the
information easily much like seen on CNBC.

\section{Unified Interfaces}

The end should experience a unified experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop browsers.
The customer should be able to use the major modern browsers: Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and
Internet Explorer to view this experience.

\section{Portfolio Management}

The end user should be able to place orders to buy, sell, short, stop, and limit, on any
tradable asset available on the NYSE and the NASDAQ with more markets to follow
after launch. The user should be able to cancel any pending orders that have not
gone through (eg, a limit order that hasn't triggered).  Users should have an
outlined overview of all of their stocks, individual stock performance, as well
as overall performance on the portfolio. They can also compare their overall
gains here to major stock indexes such as the S\&P 500 and Dow.

\section{Graphs and News}

End users should be presented with a news feed related to his/her portfolio.
Additionally they should be able to manipulate graphs in order to compare
performance of a variety of tradable assets.

\section{Email Updates}

The end user should be able to receive email updates at a frequency and
granularity that they choose.  The updates can be related to achievements,
gains/losses, or approaching deadlines. User will have ultimate control of this
function and can choose to enable or disable this function at any time.

\section{Educational Interfaces}

End users should be able to mouse over investment terms (eg, P/E ratio) and see a pop up
dialog with a brief description and links to internal and external resources.

\section{Leagues}

End users should be able to create, modify, and participate in leagues that
agree to a customizable set of rules to determine a winner (eg, the first to
double their money).  Leagues should be able to be set up by any end user and
be made public or private.  League membership is optional and a global
leader board will also be provided.

\section{Achievements}

End users should receive recognition of achievements accomplished (eg, earn 10\% in a month) and
be rewarded with additional play money, stocks, and other novel rewards.

\chapter{Product Ownership}
The project has identified 10 core pieces of functionality which will be implemented by a team of two
with the first name listed set as the go to man for that given piece of functionality.  Every team
member will be assigned a minimum of 3 pieces of functionality to be responsible for and will be
lead on no more than two pieces of functionality.
