The target demographic for the software described tends to be centered on students and
first time investors. That being said, it is likely to see the software expand to take
a large role in both university and pre-university classrooms, as a means of teaching
general financial concepts. It would not be unlikely to see the game further expand to
a larger range of users than other similar software due to increased functionality,
addition of achievement and leaderboards, and ability to join with or without league
functionality. Specifically, the addition of achievements leaves the user with the
desire to return and spend additional time trading on the software.\\

The league will be a free service with the intention of eventually moving to a
subtle-advertisement platform which will have no impact on the user. Once a
substantial enough user-base is generated, it will not be unlikely to see
advertisements begin to commence in order to bring revenue to the company. As a free
service (with eventual advertisements) we expect the platform to attract the greatest
number of users, and due to increased functionality, keep said users on the platform
for the greatest amount of time. The software is targeted not only at students and
potential investors, but at nearly everyone who desires to gain a greater understanding
of the financial industry as well as those who would simply like to practice trading
before executing in the real market.\\
