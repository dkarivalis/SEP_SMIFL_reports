\section{Persistent Data Storage}

The plan for data storage exists at the core of Paramount
Investments. Since so much of our software depends on
properly developed and updated data, it is of the utmost
important that our database schema represent accurately all
objects involved. That is, the data must accurately (at all
times) reflect all relevant user data, stock information,
ticker variables, league settings, achievements, leaderboards,
and all other relevant objects.\\

Paramount Investments will make heavy use of the relational
database MySQL. Relational databases are far more practical
for the needs of this particular software. That is, relational
databases consist of several indexed tables filled with
various object attributes. As can be viewed in the class
diagrams on the previous page, this is necessary for the
large quantity of objects which will be present in the
software. Tables will need to exist not only for user data
and settings such as log in and league profiles, but also
for stock and portfolio information. Further, these databases
need to be constantly written and rewritten to ensure
constantly updated and accurate information. Items such
as leaderboards, and information which will be able to be
viewed on each userâ€™s portfolio need to constantly reflect
accurate data.\\

The data will be retrieved from the respective database table
in the form of a query. When a user inputs a command to retrieve
data, a query must be placed, the table searched, and the eventual
correct data value (or values) returned. For example if a user
requests his or her settings, it can query currently selected
settings and return those values to the UI and to the user. If
the user elects to make a change this will be sent back to the
database, updated and saved for further access later. The same
process can be mirrored and applied to all facets of the software.
Several tables will be used for varying data as has been outlined in the diagrams above. The success of the software is dependent on the values being returned accurately and in the most updated form at all times. Because of that, the database must receive a regular feed from the Yahoo! Finance API in order to constantly update and reflect data when queries are placed. In doing so, users will have constantly accurate views of their portfolio performance, leaderboards, achievements, stock tickers, and recent trades going on throughout the league and entire user base. It is in this way that the Paramount Investment software will distinguish itself from others and retain functionality and efficient realization of its ultimate goals and requirements.
