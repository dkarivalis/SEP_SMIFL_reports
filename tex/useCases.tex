\label{useCases}

\subsection{Preface}

Users will have instant access to the functionality of the site as soon as they
have created an account and logged in. That is, they can perform all of the functions
that an investor can perform. They will also have the ability to choose to create or
join a league, though they are not required to in order to experience the full
functionality of the software. This will give our software a broader demographic
when compared to that of years prior. That being said, league creation and
administrative user delegation will be an important part of the functionality of
the program and will be described its own use case. Core functionalities of respect
user types will be elaborated below.\\

\subsection{Fully-Dressed Use Cases}

Having an account within our database is necessary for the user to experience
functionality within the software. That being said, the user can create an account in
different ways. They can choose to have the information imported by logging in through
any OpenID/OAuth service service (eg: google, facebook, twitter, etc.) This will populate
the database fields automatically with data driven from the external resources.
Once the user has created an account, they can log in through OpenID/OAuth and will
generally remain logged into the system as long as they remain logged into their service
of their choice.\\

Any user has the option at any time to create or join a league. The user who has requested
to create a league will have elevated privileges versus a standard user. The league manager
will be prompted to make a league with various setting options for victory condition, badges,
achievements, etc. The league manager can also choose whether or not to make the league private.
A private league will restrict users to those invited by the league manager, and will require
a password to join. After initial setup, league managers will have minimal access to settings.
That is, halfway through a league, the manager cannot decide to change the victory conditions.
This prevents the league manager from abusing power to tip the scales in his or her favor.\\

Of the 3 user types, administrator is the highest and reserved only for developers and
administrators of the software. Administrators have the ability to modify or delete leagues
or specific users if the administrator feels that power is being abused. The administrator
will also have elevated privileges to makes changes to the site. Their main purpose will be to
suspend or ban users or leagues and ensure that the site is not being abused. This includes but
is not limited to robot or AI users or user account spamming or advertising rather than trading
properly. \\

Depending on the specific role of the user. (I.e. investor, league manager), users should be
able to customize several different items. That is, the league manager will have ultimate
customization of the rules of his or her league, including but not limited to: victory
conditions, achievements, and starting capital. These rules are to be established prior to
the beginning of the league and not touched for the duration. League manager will also have a
few other elevated privileges depending on whether he or she also falls into the investor role
as well. Investors will be allowed to manage their own personal settings including but not
limited to: email alerts, social media integration, and notifications.\\
