\subsection{Preface}
PLACEHOLDER TEXT:\\

From our user stories, we have derived seven use cases to be fully elaborated upon.
These use cases do not necessarily fully encompass all of the requirements for
our application, but they touch upon the most important functionalities while also
covering a breadth of different aspects. Justification for why each use case was
included is written along with it. Another thing worth noting is that the browser is
an actor in each of the use cases as it is the medium through which the user interacts
with the system. As such, it will be included under the term "System" for the
fully-dressed use cases to avoid redudancy and superfluous or wordy additions to the
flow of each event. \\

\subsection{Fully-Dressed Use Cases}
PLACEHOLDER TEXT:\\

Before a user can participate in most of the functionality of our site, the user must
first join or create a league. To the user, creating a league is very similar to
joining a league, the notable differences being that the user becomes League Manager
of a league that they create and then must also invite users to join said league.
Therefore, we detail joining/creation as a single use case. User invitation, as a
responsibility of the League Manager, will be explored in a later use case. One relevant
aspect of the responsibily of a League Manager to the use case though, is whether a league
is made public or private; that is, whether it shows up in a public league listing page or
can only be joined by direct invitiation from the League Manager. Thus, our first use
case involves a business policy: \\ \\

\textbf{CG-BP01:} So that a user may create a join leagues with only their friends,
leagues marked as private will not show up on the league listings unless a user is
a current or pending member. \\

Thus, a user will only be able to browse listings of public leagues or private
leagues to which they have access. \\

\end{centering}

It is important here to note another business policy of our site relevant to the user's
experience: \\ \\

\textbf{CG-BP02:} A user is able to join an unlimited number of leagues and become
League Manager for as many leagues as the user wishes to create. \\

Though the settings are selected when creating the league, any League Manager can change
certain settings of their league at any time. These settings are comprehensive, including
such items as name, privacy, number of spots, and duration. In addition, the League Manager
can also manage members from the settings. However, certain settings cannot be
changed after the league enters active competition, such as starting capital, commission
rate, and margin, because changing primary competition rules mid-game would be unfair.\\

It is of some concern that League Managers may become abusive of their powers, and
therefore it is important to create on a policy to explicitly state how this power
is treated. In modern fantasy leagues (such as football, baseball, etc.), the
League Manager does not typically have their power moderated, and this has not caused
any problems in the success of these fantasy websites. The ability to leave a league
and join another is left to the users if they feel that their league manager has become
abusive. Their joining of the league acts as an implicit contract to accept of the
League Manager's settings. However, if this League Manager becomes a problem and users
bring it to an administrator's attention, disciplinary action may be taken. Thus we
generate the next site policy:\\ \\

\textbf{CG-BP03:} A League Manager is able to change the status of users in their league
without moderation. However, if a League Manager is deemed abusive, a site administrator
may take disciplinary action against them. \\

Core to our site is the ability of the user to have access to information about companies
so that the user may make informed decisions on how he would like to invest. As this is so
crucial to the functionality of this project, it is absolutely necessary to make
information easily available to the user and presented in a way that is clear and easy to
understand. Therefore, the search of companies as mentioned in ST-3 should be simple to use
and intuitive and the display of company profiles as mentioned in ST-4 should be such that
a user can easily access any desired information about the company's financial performance. \\

Note that the exact way in which the information requested from the Yahoo! Finance is
displayed to the user is not specified in this use case. This will be described instead
in later sections about on-screen appearance requirements as to try to separate the
functionality of the site and design of the site as separate as possible. \\

The goal of browsing companies ultimately is for the user to gain the knowledge needed to
place market orders. Market orders are the atomic action of our site; i.e. the center
point of every league is the user's ability to initiate transactions in an attempt to
invest their money as best they can. \\

The potential kinds of orders referenced in the above use case are defined in the glossary. The details on the necessary computations to enact these orders will be defined in a section later on. \\

In order to keep track of their own finances and any of their fellow league member's finances, a user must be able to view member portfolios. This keeps with the competitive nature of our site in addition to allowing the user to track their own progress. \\

Once again, the exact display of information is not defined in the use case, but rather
will be explored further in the section about user interface specifications. Next to
discuss is the tutorial as referenced in ST-8. We consider this to be one of the main
aspects that separates us from previous iterations of fantasy stock leagues; our site will
educate users new to finance and enable them to learn all about the world of finance and
how to invest, in addition to how to these subjects relate to the use of our site.\\

In order to maintain a clean fantasy finance experience for our regular users, site
administrators will reserve the ability to moderate other users--issuing warnings,
suspensions, or even bans for abusive activity. To put it explicitly: \\

\textbf{CG-BP04:} Site administrators will warn, suspend, or ban users for abusive
activity--this includes aggressive behavior on league comments or user messages,
spamming users, joining numerous leagues without active participation, and anything
else that is deemed to harm the experience for other users. \\
