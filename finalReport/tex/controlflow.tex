\section{Global Control Flow}

\subsection{Execution Order}
In general, the implementation of the system at Paramount Investments
is for the most part, event-driven.  All the features that the system
has to offer must be triggered by some entity, whether it be the user
themselves or some other part of the system.  Overall, most of the
event-driven characteristic comes from the user end of the system.
Many of the functionalities (stock trading, portfolio viewing, league
joining, etc..) can only be triggered by the user.  There are however,
some event-driven functionality that are initiated by the system. When
the user places an order, it is processed and added into the database.
From here, the system initiates the process of checking the order and
then it uses Yahoo Finance API to retrieve market information about the
stock, obtain a quote and then actually process the order.\\

There is some functionality that have to be executed in a defined order.
Before the user starts investing, they must a few steps:
\begin{itemize}

\item[--]{Registration/creating an account: any user must register
within our website before joining a league.}

\item[--]{Join a league: any user must first join a league before
they can start investing.}

\item[--]{Achievements: any user must first complete the required
criteria before they can be awarded with the achievement trophy.}

\end{itemize}

However, on the whole, our system is still definitively an event-driven one.

\subsection{Time Dependency}
In general, the system at Paramount Investments is very much a real-time system,
but there are features that do not depend on time.  The real-time system is very
reliant on the stock market, which itself has certain times of operation.  As
the user is browsing the website, there are real-time timers that help the system
process information that it is receiving.

\begin{itemize}
\item[--]{Achievement Timer: This timer is used at the end of the day to check
for achievement specs for all the users.  Achievements/ rewards will then be
    dished out accordingly.}

\item[--]{Stock Market open and close: The stock market has a time interval
between when itâ€™s open and when it is closed.}

\item[--]{Queuing system: the orders placed by users are placed into a queue.
Depending on market conditions, this can place high loads on the server.
To balance the server load, we must split the orders effectively.  The timer
in this system helps to check for unexecuted/ outstanding orders and then processes
them.}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Concurrency}
There are sub-systems in our main system which have to be carefully thought of
due to concurrency.  The biggest of these is the queuing subsystem.  This produces
a concurrency issue because we have to make sure that no more than 1 order is being
inserted into the queue at any given time.  Likewise, we also have to make sure that
no more than 1 order is being dequeued from a given queue.  Other than this our system
really does not need any synchronization.  However, this may change as we are
implementing our system.
