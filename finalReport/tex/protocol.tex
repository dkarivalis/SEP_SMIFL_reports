\section{Network Protocol}

As is standard for software of this type, Paramount Investments
will uses the standard Hypertext Transfer Protocal (HTTP). HTTP
acts by structuring text which is uses hyperlinks to communicate
messages through text between nodes. While not necessarily unique
or particular to our situation, it is still important to note that
this will be the primary protocol between user and software
interface. More importantly, the HTTP protocol will be used not
only on web-based devices but also on Android and iOS devices as
well. From any of these mediums, the users can access various
webpages and links from the Paramount Investment website. They will
be able to access, through this protocol, all relevant stock,
portfolio, and relevant information through these pages and by
using the HTTP protocol.
