\section{On-Screen Appearance Requirements}



There are a few on screen requirements that will be universal to the entire site:\\
\renewcommand\arraystretch{2}
\begin{longtable}{|p{0.6in}|p{4.6in}|}
\hline
{\large \color{color1}Identifier}&{\large \color{color1}Requirement} \\ \hline

OSR-1& Every page has a scrolling ticker across the bottom of the page to update the user
on stock movement. \\ \hline

OSR-2& Every page, with the exception of the login page, will have
navigational links across the top, the user's username and their current position in
the leaderboard. \\ \hline

\end{longtable}


There are also the following requirements for specific pages:\\

\renewcommand\arraystretch{2}
\begin{longtable}{|p{0.6in}|p{4.6in}|}
\hline
{\large \color{color1}Identifier}&{\large \color{color1}Requirement} \\ \hline

OSR-3&  A custom 404 not found page will be displayed to a user when they try to  access
a URL/URI that doesn't exist or is not designed for them to be accessing. \\ \hline

OSR-4& On the portfolio page users will find currently owned stocks, charts and graphs,
trade transcations, and a news feed. \\ \hline

OSR-5&  The leaderboard view will contain users ranked by the top networth from their
respective portfolios. \\ \hline

OSR-6&  The login page will present the user with login icons representing the service
they can use to log into our system, eg: google+, facebook, etc. \\ \hline

\end{longtable}

\newpage
The below image gives a general representation of the on-screen requirements for the login page. You will note here that this is a general design strategy where a background image and login pattern will be debuted upon final release. The idea, however, is to demonstrate a framework for what the user can expect to see upon entering our webpage. More importantly, this framework will be the first impression the user has of our site and will be retouched and refined as necessary. The outline is shown above.\\
