\section{Mapping Hardware to Subsystems}

The Paramount Investments League is contained on a MySQL
database server, which is stored on one machine. However,
the system as a whole is spread across several machines. The
system to be is divided into two separate sections: a front-end
side that is run on the clientâ€™s web browser of choice, and a
back-end that runs on the server side of the database. The front-end
is the main graphical user interface (GUI) between the system and
the client. The front-end is responsible for communication between
the GUI and the database for purposes such as confirming market
orders and updating an investors portfolio. These changes in the
front-end are reflected in the back-end side of the server. The
back-end will handle proper execution of market orders and will
updates users on each of their transactions.
