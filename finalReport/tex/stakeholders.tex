In general, a stakeholder is someone in an organization or group that is affects or is affected by the decision made by that particular organization or group. For the Paramount Investments League, any user (investor) in a league will be considered a primary stakeholder because any transaction made within their league, will influence other users investors.\\

The target demographic for the software described tends to be centered on students and first time investors, as a result, it is unlikely that novice investors will participate in real trade without any experience. That being said, it is likely to see the software expand to take a large role in both university and pre-university classrooms, as a means of teaching general financial concepts. It would not be unlikely to see the game further expand to a larger range of users than other similar software due to increased functionality, addition of achievement and leaderboards, and ability to join with or without league functionality. Specifically, the addition of achievements leaves the user with the desire to return and spend additional time trading on the software.\\

The league will be a free service with the intention of eventually moving to a subtle-advertisement platform which will have no impact on the user. Once a substantial enough user-base is generated, it will not be unlikely to see advertisements begin to commence in order to bring revenue to the company. As a free service (with eventual advertisements) we expect the platform to attract the greatest number of users, and due to increased functionality, keep said users on the platform for the greatest amount of time. The software is targeted not only at students and potential investors, but at nearly everyone who desires to gain a greater understanding of the financial industry as well as those who would simply like to practice trading before executing in the real market.\\
